# OdinClasses
I'm planning to use this repository for the Odin Project files that I hack out.  It's anybody's guess how far I'll get, but it's going to be fun to try,

OK, so far I've setup a GitHub account, one repo just to try it out, one under the Odin aegis, cloned it on my local machine,
changed things and committed the change on local machine.
I still need to push my local changes into the GitHub repo.
