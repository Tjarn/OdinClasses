    <h1>Homepage</h1>

    <p>This is an example of an anchor element.
    </p>
    
    <a>click me</a>
    <p>
        Clicking does nothing as it needs a destination to which it will link. That
        destination is the URL https://www.theodinproject.com/about.  The actual
        command then becomes:
    </p>
    <p>
        &lta href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about"&gtclick me&lt/a&gt
    </p> 
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        So the &lta&gt tags nail down an anchor and the href is set to 
        the destination of the anchor to make it a link.
    </p>
    <a href="pages/about.html">About</a>
    <p>
        The href may be a fully qualified domain name, or may resemble a relative
        file pathname just like a unix filepath name.  Think of fully qualified 
        domain name as the root of an absolute file pathname.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luckily I got my relative/absolute relationship a long time ago in the
        unix file system.  So onward and upward...
    </p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>&ltimg&gt</strong> element lets us put an image on the page. The img element is self-closing 
        and therefor does not need, nore does it tolerate a &lt/img&gt tag.
        I'll check on that later.
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">
    <p>
        Since I don't know much about that image, I'd like to resize it, so I'll just
        wait and see if I can do that.
    </p>
    <p>
        OK, here's a test to see if relative paths work:
        <img src="./images/dog.jpeg" alt="Replusive dog." height="10" width="10">

    </p>
    <p>
        Ummm... that was way more dog than I want.  I know some folks find them cute.
        I only find them repulsive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Came bach and you just put in heght="n" width="n"
        I wonder what 10 and 10 would do"
    </p>
    <p>
        Surprise!  I don't think that dog has looked better short of 0x0
    </p>
    <p>
        Time to get back to work.  
    </p>
    <p>
        OK, a site <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com">Interneting is HardS</a>
        Part of it's on the OP curriculum.  I bookmarked it for later 
        study.
