    In this state, characters are streaming.  The point of conciousness travels from the first character
    of this file to the last, a passage of time that we are not bound to. It is a virtual time, a sequence
    of characters that pass, the sequence of sequences. Think of the meaning of this sentence. The sentence
    just before this changed the meaning of this sentence before it existed. That's a thought about the 
    sentence two sentences before this. Then think of the meaning of this sentence as you consider how it
    relates to the three preceeding it.  Wow.


    <p>
        Our state just changed.  The stream of conciousness encountered a '&lt' character. Then a 'p'
        character. Then, finally, a '&gt' character.  Each character caused a change of state.  The first
        signalled the beginning of the command and the rest of the characters would build the command while
        the third would terminate and change state to what the enclosed characters suggested.
