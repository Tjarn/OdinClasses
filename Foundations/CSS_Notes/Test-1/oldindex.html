<h1>CSS Notes</h1>
<p class="body-text">
    I'm using this document to experiment with and to document what I'm learning about CSS.
    As happens in many cases, I'm expecting the process of writing it down to help me to learn
    the material better.  So moving it from short-term to long-term memory, and understanding
    how and why it works is the name of this game.
</p>
    <h2>CSS -- What it is</h2>
    <p class="body-text">
        In order for me to fully understand something, I usually need to build a mental model of 
        some sort. That's what I'm doing here.  I hope that by writing things out, I can nail down the
        concepts hard enough that they stick long enough to use.  I'll be messing around with styling
        in here, so hope to have some demos that I can mess with.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">    <p class="body-text">

        What is it?  From what I can see from this point in my learning is that it's a method of selecting
        html entities and adding specifications as to how they render. It looks like it is in the same
        place as PostScript is with printing in speaking to a web browser.  The computer pumps out encoded
        binary streams to either, one renders graphical text on a printer, the other renders graphics and 
        text on a browser screen.  Of course the printed rendition is static and the other is dynamic, so 
        the parallel is limited.  But for now it looks like a way to add 'HOW' to html's WHAT.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        More specifically it is a number of methods of identifying, marking, and combining discrete html 
        entities and specifying ways to render them. From there, it looks to get complicated fast.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Here's a selection from a random CSS file in my Linux system:
    </p>
    <code>
        
table.navigation 
{
  background: #ffeeee;
  border: solid 1px #ffaaaa;
  margin-top: 0.5em;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}
.navigation a 
{
  color: #770000;
}
.navigation a:visited 
{
  color: #550000;
}
.navigation .title 
{
  font-size: 200%;
}
    </code>

    <p class="body-text">
        Basically, it consists of a line that runs through a complicated pattern matcher, and when matched
        delivers the contents of the {} delimited block that follows the pattern line.  The contents of the 
        block are one or more semicolon (;) terminated lines. These lines are colon (:) split.  Most seem
        to set some sort of displayed property.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        I need to take some of these patterns apart to see how they work.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        Let's start with the simplest.  '*' asterisk, star, splat.  It matches anything like in sh or bash.
        if we had the css lines:
    </p>
    <code>
        ...}
          p
        { font-size: 26Px}
        ...
    </code>

    <p class="body-text">
        A common container is &ltp&gt - and that won't show up in a text editor. But that's what the p matches.
        It's like it hollers to all the 'p's out there SET YOUR FONTS TO 26! In this document I'm using the 
        container &ltp class="body-text"&gt for all normal paragraphs.  I should be able to match those containers
        with the line p.body-text.  So the code to set the font-size to 26 pixels would be:

    </p>
    <code>
        p.body-text {
            font-size: 26px;
        }
    </code>

    <p class="body-text">
        So I tried it and it worked exactly as advertised.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        Now to figure out how to experiment with selectors and stuff...  Perhaps work out a series of
        tags and selectors, and see if I can get a mental model of how some of this works, and something to
        test if I'm wrong.  
    </p>



    <h2>Using Stylesheet Files</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
        If you want to use a file as a stylesheet for a document, you must explicitly link as:
        <code>link rel="stylesheet" href="yourfilename.css"</code>
  
        For example, if we were preparing a document named generic-document.html we could
        cause it to look for a stylesheet, 'styles.css' in the same directory as your document with the
        line:
    </p>
    <code><link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /></code>

    <h3>Stylesheet Naming</h3>
    <p class="body-text">
        The name need not be 'styles.css' -- one convention could be 'generic-document.css' to go with 
        'generic-document.html'.  In this specific case, since this file's name is 'index.html' the 
        obvious is index.css. In practice I don't know well or ill that would work.  So I'll do both and
        comment one out. Or, if it looks useful I may have other stylesheets I can try and comment all 
        but one out.  Whatever looks good when I get there.  
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">Let's see if the idea of renaming style sheets might work. something like 
        1-test.css and 7.3-test.css.  Change it in the link line and mark it in the source.</p>
