    <h1>Test Plan for CSS</h1>

    <p class="intro">This document is simply a record of my tests using css in an external
        file.  I'll set up the test document, the .css file, then save an image of what it renders.
        For each test I'll use the same text and have a screen shot of with and without the css.
    </p>
    <p class="foo">
        I'll need to develop a html document to render. It looks like google 
        <style="color: black; background-color: green;>chrome</style>
        is the target
        browser, so I'll want to use that for my rendering. I don't normally use chrome, so it won't 
        be a temptation to add stuff.  Vanilla chrome for rendering.  So testing setup will be 
        a vanilla html file, external .css file, chrome browser to render, and a screen shot to 
        record test results.
    </p>
    <p>Another possibility is a single file to render with internal <style></style>tag</p>
