    This is text after &ltbody&gt. It seems to be working fine. 

    It treats multiple white spaces
    as a single space.  So what about putting it in a div container?
    <div>OK, this is in a div ending here.</div><div>OK, another</div><div>and another</div>
    And this is after the last div
    <div style="background-color:aqua">Now this is in a new div with the background color changed.
    Use the browser's right mouse button to bring up a menu and something like view page source should
    let you see where it changes. </div>
    <div>Now we're back in a plain div.  Does the color stay or revert?  My intuition says it should
        revert, but no refunds allowed.
    </div>
    <p>Now we are ticking along inside a p container until it gets to the end and we pop out</p>
    <div class="foobar">into another div container.  This one is a bit different though, it has
        an attribute called class.  In the dev header we've got the class="foobar" property.  When we
        look at the matching, the pattern div.foobar looks like what I'd call a match
    </div>
    <div>Now I'll go up into the head and see if div.foobar matches the last container.
        I'll use the line 'div.foobar{color:white;background-color:darkblue;}' It matched. Now
        to see if '.foobar' matches. </div>
    <p>
        This is in a p container 
    </p>
    
    <p class="foobar">
        And this in a p.foobar container.
    </p>
    <div>And back to a plain div</div>

</body>
