    <h1>
        Ordered and Unordered Lists
    </h1>
    <p>
        In this section I'll try a couple of lists.  There are two
        types of lists that we need to consider, ordered and unordered.
        First, The commanalities:
    </p>
    <p>
        One: Both types of lists are bounded by tags as are most other
        html objects.  Both lists are two letter tags ending in 'l'.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two: Each item in a list starts with the &ltli&gt tag and
        ends with the &lt/li&gt tag.
    </p>
    <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
    <p>
        Unordered lists are bounded by the tag pair &ltul&gt and 
        &lt/ul&gt. Within the list, each element is bounded by the tag
        pair &ltli&gt and &lt/li&gt.  I would expect this to mean that
        you can change an ordered list to an unordered list by changing
        the enclosing tags.
