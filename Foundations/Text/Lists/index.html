    <h1>
        Ordered and Unordered Lists
    </h1>
    <p>
        In this section I'll try a couple of lists.  There are two
        types of lists that we need to consider, ordered and unordered.
        First, The commanalities:
    </p>
    <p>
        One: Both types of lists are bounded by tags as are most other
        html objects.  Both lists are two letter tags ending in 'l'.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two: Each item in a list starts with the &ltli&gt tag and
        ends with the &lt/li&gt tag.
    </p>
    <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
    <p>
        Unordered lists are bounded by the tag pair &ltul&gt and 
        &lt/ul&gt. Within the list, each element is bounded by the tag
        pair &ltli&gt and &lt/li&gt.  I would expect this to mean that
        you can change an ordered list to an unordered list by changing
        the enclosing list tags.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example of an unordered list, let's try to set one up
        inside this paragraph.  Look at the source of this page to see
        the list after this text.

        <ul>
            <li>Hamburger</li>
            <li>French Fries</li>
            <li>Milkshake</li>
            <li>Hot Peppers</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The list worked just fine, and each element recieved a bullet
        prefix as a format. Now let's try the same list outside the bounds
        of the current paragraph.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hamburger</li>
        <li>French Fries</li>
        <li>Milkshake</li>
        <li>Hot Peppers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The previous list is before this paragraph and after the last.
        I don't see any difference whether it's enclosed in 
        paragraph tags or not.
    </p>
    <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
    <p>
    To make an ordered list, enclose the list elements in the 
    &gtol&lt and &gt/ol&lt tags.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hamburger</li>
        <li>French Fries</li>
        <li>Milkshake</li>
        <li>Hot Peppers</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The obvious difference is the change of the bullet points 
        to a sequential list of items.  I'm going to mess around 
        for a while and see what happens when you put lists inside
        list items.  Being lazy, I'll just use the list items I've
        already typed in.
    </p>
    <h3>An ordered list of unorded lists</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Hamburger</li>
                <li>French Fries</li>
                <li>Milkshake</li>
                <li>Hot Peppers</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Hamburger</li>
                <li>French Fries</li>
                <li>Milkshake</li>
                <li>Hot Peppers</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Hamburger</li>
                <li>French Fries</li>
                <li>Milkshake</li>
                <li>Hot Peppers</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ol>
    <p>
        Obviously there's no internal logic about lists that makes
        an internal difference in an html document.  That substatutive
        difference is in the real world meaning of the list.  
    </p>
    <p>
        And as for me, I find that i can ramble on like this having
        a good time as I go.
