    <h1>Commit Messages</h1>
    <p>
        OK, I'm bad here.  I need to improve and I also need the part
        about how often to commit.  I think this thing is far overdue!.

        Well it didn't seem too big a chore.  It was definitely a big chunk 
        though.  Next to push to GitHub.

<code>
    <p>
$ git status
</p><p>
On branch main
</p><p>
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
</p><p>
nothing to commit, working tree clean

<h2>Good Resolutions</h2>
    <p>
        I hope that the sense of resolution I'm getting from this
        lesson lasts.  It's the same kind of sense that I'm trying to make with
        a series of rambles around my self education.  The resolution that I'll 
        do either the project or something as close as I can stand and aiming
        for the same educational benifits.

        <h3>Seven rules of a good Git commit message</h3>
