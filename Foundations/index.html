    <h1>Foundations</h1>
    <p>
        This is the Odin Project(OP)'s required first course.  A lot like remedial math or
        'bonehead English' as we called it in my High School.  Vo-Ag (Vocational Agriculture)
        was the largest school department, and the largest school club was the FFA (Future
        Farmers of America). I really wanted to take the Vo-Ag Welding and Auto Mechanics
        classes, but you had to be part of the program to take them.  So I took a correspondence
        course in Radio and Television Repair instead. Vacuum tubes are pretty simple but 
        calculations by hand (pre handheld calculator days) were a real pain.
        </p><p>
        That class probably fed me for more years of my life than any other single influence.
        </p><p>
        That and typing.  I took typing because of an intense adolescent crush on the typing
        teacher who was first year out of the teacher's college, and to my young eyes the
        prettiest thing I'd ever seen.  So to keep from her scorn, I worked very hard at 
        forcing my fumbling fingers up to 60 words per minute with no errors.  I think that
        was the peak of my typing speed.

        The following links are to sections of the Foundations course.  I'm skipping the introductions
        and stuff on Boilerplate HTML.  The first is on Text.
        And, ahh heck, let's make it an unordered list.

     <ul>
        <li><a href="Text/index.html">Text</a></li>
        <li><a href="Lists/index.html">Lists</a></li>
        <li><a href="Links-Images/index.html">Links and Images</a></li>

    </ul>
    </p><p>
        That looks a lot better and a lot more useable.
