        I'm very sure that if I keep my notes for this class and potentially more classes
        as static web pages, then I'll have something of value.  And since the best time
        to index is as soon as it's written, it seems like it's a good time to have links
        written up to tie the anchors to their targets.

        I'll try to keep each of the Odin project's class title for the index.html file
        in that class.  If I keep the name of the directory the same as OP uses for the
        class or lesson, the page links should look pretty good.  I should be able to browse
        over and review a lot more efficiently than just wandering around a directory tree.

        Foudations is the OP's first class.  I'm closing in on the halfway mark. So far
        the only real fail is hooking up to the OP's Discord server. I haven't managed
        yet.  I'll keep trying.  But if there's no help for getting to the help system
        is it a systematic error?  At any rate, If I keep hammering things out in html,
        I should at least get some good practice in. <p>
        </p> I do remember doing some bare 
        html coding while working for Tektronix as a Tech Writer in the 1980's. So the 
        concepts here are well known.

        One thing I do remember is that I would write in paragraphs that I'd indicate with 
        spaces.  The HTML parser would ignore them so I could put &ltp&gt&lt/p&gt in the blanks
        later, to 
        make it less intrusive while writing.
